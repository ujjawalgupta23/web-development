Squirrels are small to medium-sized rodents found in many parts of the world. They are known for their bushy tails and their ability to climb trees and jump from branch to branch with agility. There are more than 200 species of squirrels, and they come in a variety of colors and sizes.

Most <b>squirrels</b> have sharp <b>claws </b> that help them grip tree bark and climb branches. They also have sharp teeth that they use to gnaw on nuts, seeds, and other food. Squirrels are omnivorous, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Some common foods for squirrels include acorns, pine cones, berries, insects, and even small birds or eggs.

Squirrels are known for their hoarding behavior, where they collect and store food for later use. They have specialized cheek pouches that allow them to carry multiple items at once. Squirrels can remember where they have stored their food and will return to those locations later when they need to eat.
